    "Alternate method: Yes, instead of using select('a'), we can first select the 'li' under class='cl-results-page', then use the findChildren() option to select the children of 'li', and the first element in the child wil be <a> where our url will be. And subsequenty we can use this logic in a loop similar to above to identify all the listed items. The approach will follow something like \"soup.select('li',class_='cl-results-page')[i].findChildren()[0].get('href')\" to get the url of an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 250 urls were printed based on the fact that we were able to get more than 250 listing items in our first requests to the sorted url. This method was also validated with the website by checking the top 250 items.\n",
    "We then used the select 'li' with class, and further select 'a' and get the url with 'href' for top 250 items under \\<li> \\</li>. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't consider the pagination feature of Craigslist to navigate through pages here. However, this can also be done. Since, from our exploration we know that there are only 120 items listed in the url, we can run the requests for each page and get the listing from top 1-120 for first two pages, and the top 1-10 for the last page. While doing this, we should also make sure to set a time.sleep() to not bombard the website with different requests in a very short time. "
